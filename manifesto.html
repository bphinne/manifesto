<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="box"><p>Akin to a humanist manifesto[1], but geared towards the cute, the alternative, the colorful, and the grunge.</p>

<p>An exploration of how cute has no boundaries. No restrictions.</p>

<p>To explore the self through an artistic expression that almost fleetingly changes from cute to dark and gothic.</p>

<p>Inspired in youth by Camilla d’Errico’s Dappled Daydreams[2] and explorations of the cute and nonrealistic. </p>

<p>Anyone can learn, it’s just a matter of dedication and the passage of time.</p>

<p>I pour my soul into my work, using cuteness to disguise and convey how I feel.</p> 

<p>It’s a powerful outlet, and one that needs no words spoken to understand.</p>

<p>I express the everyday, the emotions, and the passions of my life through cute imagery that transcends boundaries.</p>
